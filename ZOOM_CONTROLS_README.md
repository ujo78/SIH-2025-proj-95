# Zoom Controls and Camera Features

## ðŸŽ® Controls Added

### Traffic Flow Demo (`traffic_flow_demo.py`)
- **Mouse Wheel Up**: Zoom in (get closer to the scene)
- **Mouse Wheel Down**: Zoom out (move away from the scene)
- **Left Mouse Drag**: Rotate camera around the scene
- **Number Keys 1-6**: Switch between different visualization scenarios
- **ESC**: Exit the demo

### Traffic Visualization Demo (`traffic_visualization_demo.py`)
- **Mouse Wheel Up**: Zoom in towards the center
- **Mouse Wheel Down**: Zoom out from the center
- **Arrow Keys**: Move camera position
- **Space**: Pause/Resume simulation
- **E**: Trigger emergency scenario
- **C**: Clear all alerts
- **R**: Reset simulation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Zoom Functionality
- **Smooth Zoom**: Camera distance is adjusted incrementally
- **Distance Limits**: Zoom is clamped between 20 and 500 units to prevent getting too close or too far
- **Target-Based**: Camera always looks at the center of the scene (origin point)

### Camera System
- **Spherical Coordinates**: Camera position calculated using distance, horizontal angle, and pitch angle
- **Mouse Rotation**: Drag to rotate around the scene center
- **Smooth Movement**: All camera movements are smooth and responsive

## ðŸš€ Running the Demos

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the focused TrafficFlowVisualizer demo
python traffic_flow_demo.py

# Run the full traffic simulation demo
python traffic_visualization_demo.py
```

### Demo Features

#### Traffic Flow Demo

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Tips

### Best Zoom Practices
- Start with the default view to get oriented
- Use mouse wheel for quick zoom adjustments
- Drag with left mouse button to find the best viewing angle
- Try different scenarios (keys 1-6) to see various features

### Performance
- The demos are optimized for real-time performance
- Zoom controls are responsive and smooth
- All visualizations update dynamically with camera changes

### Troubleshooting
- If the demo doesn't start, ensure Panda3D is installed: `pip install panda3d`
- If zoom feels too fast/slow, the sensitivity can be adjusted in the code
- Press ESC to exit cleanly from any demo

## ðŸ“Š Visualization Features

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Free-flowing traffic
- **Yellow**: Light traffic
- **Orange**: Moderate traffic
- **Red**: Heavy traffic/congestion
- **Dark Red**: Severe congestion

### Interactive Elements
- **Pulsing Hotspots**: Indicate congestion severity
- **Flashing Alerts**: Emergency scenarios with different colors per type
- **Animated Particles**: Show traffic flow direction and speed
- **Route Lines**: Multiple route options for navigation

The zoom controls make it easy to explore the 3D traffic visualization from any angle and distance, providing an immersive experience for analyzing Indian traffic patterns and congestion scenarios.

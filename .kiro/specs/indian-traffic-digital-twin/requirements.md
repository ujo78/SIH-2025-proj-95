# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Indian Traffic Digital Twin system is designed to create a comprehensive simulation and analysis platform for Indian traffic patterns. This system will model the unique characteristics of Indian traffic including mixed vehicle types, varying road conditions, and complex behavioral patterns to provide insights for traffic management and urban planning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traffic researcher, I want to simulate realistic Indian traffic scenarios, so that I can analyze traffic patterns and test management strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL load Indian road networks from OpenStreetMap data
2. WHEN simulating traffic THEN the system SHALL support mixed vehicle types including cars, motorcycles, auto-rickshaws, buses, and trucks
3. WHEN vehicles are spawned THEN they SHALL follow Indian traffic behavioral patterns including lane flexibility and gap acceptance
4. WHEN the simulation runs THEN it SHALL maintain realistic vehicle densities and flow rates for Indian conditions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an urban planner, I want to visualize traffic flow in 3D, so that I can better understand spatial traffic patterns and congestion points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualization is activated THEN the system SHALL render a 3D representation of the road network
2. WHEN vehicles are moving THEN they SHALL be displayed as 3D models with appropriate Indian vehicle types
3. WHEN viewing the simulation THEN users SHALL be able to navigate the 3D environment with camera controls
4. WHEN traffic conditions change THEN the visualization SHALL update in real-time with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a traffic engineer, I want to analyze congestion patterns, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize traffic signal timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL collect traffic flow metrics including speed, density, and throughput
2. WHEN congestion occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and highlight congested areas
3. WHEN analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL generate congestion heat maps and flow diagrams
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide metrics in formats suitable for traffic engineering analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to model Indian-specific traffic conditions, so that I can study the impact of weather, road quality, and mixed traffic on flow patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather conditions are set THEN vehicle behavior SHALL adapt to rain, fog, or clear conditions
2. WHEN road quality varies THEN vehicle speeds and lane-changing behavior SHALL adjust accordingly
3. WHEN mixed traffic is present THEN the system SHALL model interactions between different vehicle types
4. WHEN emergency scenarios occur THEN the system SHALL simulate appropriate response behaviors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a simulation analyst, I want to export data to MATLAB, so that I can perform advanced statistical analysis and create custom visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL export vehicle trajectories to MATLAB-compatible formats
2. WHEN exporting road networks THEN the system SHALL convert graph data to formats compatible with MATLAB analysis tools
3. WHEN integrating with Simulink THEN the system SHALL provide real-time data streaming capabilities
4. WHEN using RoadRunner THEN the system SHALL import and convert scene files for simulation use

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a traffic control operator, I want to simulate emergency scenarios, so that I can test response protocols and evacuation procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emergency scenarios are activated THEN the system SHALL simulate accidents, road closures, or emergency vehicle movements
2. WHEN emergencies occur THEN traffic SHALL be rerouted according to predefined protocols
3. WHEN emergency vehicles are present THEN other traffic SHALL yield appropriately according to Indian traffic rules
4. WHEN scenarios complete THEN the system SHALL provide analysis of response effectiveness and traffic impact

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure simulation parameters, so that I can customize the system for different Indian cities and traffic conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN users SHALL be able to set vehicle mix ratios appropriate for different Indian cities
2. WHEN setting up scenarios THEN users SHALL be able to define custom road conditions and traffic signal timing
3. WHEN running simulations THEN users SHALL be able to adjust weather conditions and time-of-day effects
4. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL store and reload custom scenario templates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want the system to run efficiently, so that I can simulate large-scale traffic networks without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simulating large networks THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time performance for networks with up to 1000 vehicles
2. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures to minimize memory footprint
3. WHEN running long simulations THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance over extended time periods
4. WHEN multiple scenarios run THEN the system SHALL support parallel execution where computationally feasible
